## Requirements

- Docker & docker-compose
- Nodejs & npm

If you do not have **docker**, [install it](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

About **Nodejs & npm**, you can install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).


## Installation & Usage

### 1. Configure your .env file

Create an `.env` file and copy the `.env.docker` content file to `.env`, configuring the variables as you prefer.

The most important variables are:
```bash
DOCKER_WORDPRESS_URL=http://localhost # the url of the website
DOCKER_WORDPRESS_TITLE=ACoreCMS # the title of the website
DOCKER_WORDPRESS_ADMIN_USER=admin # the wordpress admin username
DOCKER_WORDPRESS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin # the wordpress admin password
DOCKER_WORDPRESS_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com # the wordpress admin email
```

### 2. Build and start the docker containers

```
npm run docker:install
```

This process will take some time, once everything is done you should get a message like this in your console:

```
php-1        | [31-Dec-2024 13:13:27] NOTICE: fpm is running, pid 1
php-1        | [31-Dec-2024 13:13:27] NOTICE: ready to handle connections
```

Now you can see the website in [http://localhost:80/](http://localhost:80/).

Make sure that your port 80 is not already used by another service like Apache2, nginx etc.

If you want to change the port, you can change it from `.env` through the parameter `DOCKER_HTTP_PORTS` and `DOCKER_HTTPS_PORTS`.

Example:
```
DOCKER_HTTP_PORTS=8080:80
DOCKER_HTTPS_PORTS=443:443
```

The env variables above are used to configure the ports within the docker-compose file. To understand how port configurations work in docker-compose, please take a look at the [official documentation](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/master/spec.md#ports)

**Note**: if you change this after the wordpress installation remember to change also the siteurl and related wordpress parameters in `wp_options` table.

Finally, you can stop your containers with `Ctrl+C`

### 3. Run WordPress in background

You probably don't want to have your terminal busy with the docker-compose logs, so you can run the containers in background mode:

```bash
npm run docker:start:d
```


### 4. Update the containers

If you want to update the containers, you can run the following command:

```bash
npm run docker:update
```

NOTE: wordpress files and database will be preserved. To update the wordpress version, you need install it manually through the admin panel.

### Work with local source files

By default, the source files of the wordpress installation are stored in a named volume. This is useful for production environments, but if you want to work with the source files locally, you can use a host folder instead of the named volume.
You can set the `DOCKER_WORDPRESS_SRC_PATH` variable in the `.env` file to the path of the host folder you want to use.

```bash
DOCKER_WORDPRESS_SRC_PATH=./srv
```

### Export and import source files from the named volume

#### Export source files

You can export the source files of the current wordpress installation inside the /srv folder (backup) with the following command:

```bash
npm run docker:src:export
```

#### Import source files

You can import the source files under /srv folder inside the /var/www/html container folder(restore backup) with the following command:

```bash
npm run docker:src:import
```

IMPORTANT: this command needs to be executed with a bash-compatible shell and it will stop the php running container. After the import is done, you can start the container again.


### AzerothCore integration

ACore CMS is designed to work with AzerothCore. The ac-network included in our docker-compose file is a network that connects the AzerothCore server with the CMS. This network can be flagged as external which means that you need an azerothcore server spinned up using its own docker-compose file to make it work. 
If you are using azerothcore with the docker-compose file provided by us, you can running acore-cms with docker by setting DOCKER_AC_NETWORK_EXTERNAL to true in the .env file.

Please check this guide: [Connect the CMS to AcoreDocker and enable the shop](https://github.com/azerothcore/acore-cms/blob/master/docs/configure-acore-docker.md)

### Multirealm support

ACoreCMS is designed to support multiple AzerothCore realms by creating new WordPress sites. Multi-site support is enabled by default, but it can be switched off before the installation if desired. This allows you to create multiple websites within a single WordPress installation. You can manage multiple AzerothCore realms by creating a new WordPress site for each realm.

NOTE: AzerothCore plugin supports a single connection with a single character database, which is why it's important to create multiple sites such that each site has different character connections.

#### Subdomain vs. Subpath

You can choose to create new websites either in a subdomain or a subpath. This is controlled by the `DOCKER_MULTISITE_USE_SUBDOMAIN` environment variable.

- **Subdomain**: If you set `DOCKER_MULTISITE_USE_SUBDOMAIN` to `true`, new websites will be created in a subdomain (e.g., `site1.example.com`, `site2.example.com`).
- **Subpath**: If you set `DOCKER_MULTISITE_USE_SUBDOMAIN` to `false`, new websites will be created in a subpath (e.g., `example.com/site1`, `example.com/site2`).

## Nginx Configuration for Subdomain Support

If you choose to use subdomains, you need to create an Nginx configuration to support the subdomains. This can be done by setting the `DOCKER_CONF_NGINX_PATH` environment variable and creating your own Nginx configuration file.

Please follow this guide to configure Nginx for subdomain support: [Nginx Configuration for Multisite Support](nginx-for-multisite.md)

By following these steps, you can configure your WordPress installation to support multiple AzerothCore realms using either subdomains or subpaths.

### CLI commands available

```bash
npm run docker:install # install the docker containers

npm run docker:update # update the docker containers

npm run docker:start # start the docker containers in foreground

npm run docker:start:d # start the docker containers in background (deamon)

npm run docker:shell # open a bash shell inside the php container

```


### Using docker-compose.override.yml to extend the default one

If the .env variables that we provide are not enough for your configuration needs, you can always use the official ["docker-compose override" strategy](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/).

We've provided a sample `docker-compose.override.yml` file within the `/data/` directory that includes a phpmyadmin container. You can copy/paste that file
within the root directory of this project (it is git-ignored) and configure it as you prefer. Make sure to read the official docker-compose documentation first
to exactly understand how to use it.


## How to export/import database with the integrated tool

Acore-cms integrates a script under `/apps/db_exporter` folder that helps you to export the entire database in a SQL dump format.
This script uses the /conf/dist/conf.sh file to configure the db credentials. If you need to change those configurations, you can just
copy/paste that file inside the /conf/ folder to override default values (the files in that directory are git-ignored).

NOTE: by default sql files will be exported inside the /data/sql folder

### database export

`npm run docker:db:export`

### database import

`npm run docker:db:import`


### Install acore-wp-plugin as standalone

If you want to install the acore-wp-plugin as a standalone plugin, you can follow the instructions in the [acore-wp-plugin repository](https://github.com/azerothcore/acore-cms-wp-plugin).
